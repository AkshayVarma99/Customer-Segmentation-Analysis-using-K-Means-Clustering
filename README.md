# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis-using-K-Means-Clustering
This project grouped customers together based on how much they spend, their age, and how much money they make. We used a method called K-Means clustering to do this.

# Overview
Customer segmentation is crucial for businesses to understand their customers better and tailor marketing strategies accordingly. By clustering customers into groups with similar characteristics, businesses can target their advertising efforts more effectively.

# Features
Data Exploration: Analyze the dataset to understand the distribution of customer attributes.
K-Means Clustering: Use the K-Means algorithm to segment customers into distinct groups.
Visualization: Visualize the clusters in 3D space to understand customer segments better.

# Usage
Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
Run the customer_segmentation.py script to perform clustering analysis.
View the results and visualizations generated in the output.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains information about customers' spending behavior, age, and annual income. It can be found in the directory.
